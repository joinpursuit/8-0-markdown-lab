## Instructions

1. Unzip the downloaded file. It will create a folder of the same name in your Downloads folder.

1. Navigate to the folder and open it with VSCode. Then, follow the instructions below.

### Completing this Lab

The [needs-formatting.md](./needs-formatting.md) file in this repository needs just that: formatting! Using what you know of markdown, update the text so that it is well formatting.

In front or above each block of text will be a Markdown comment that describes how it should be formatted.

For example, the following code:

```md
<!-- Change to an H3 -->

All about Dogs
```

Should be updated to look like this:

```md
<!-- Change to an H3 -->

### All about Dogs
```
